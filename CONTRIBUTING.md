## 💻 We Use GitHub Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests When Contributing

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. 🍴 Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. 📝 When creating a pull request, please use our pull request template.
3. ✅ If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. 🚦 Ensure the test suite passes if any.
5. 🔍 Make sure your code lints.
6. 📤 Issue that pull request!
7. 🛠️ Once the issue has been reviewed and approved, it should be squashed and merged.

## 🌲 Branching and committing

Please follow these guidelines when creating branches:

- Tag your branch with a valid branch type followed by a forward slash. Describe it using snake case. e.g., `feature/add_login_page` or `documentation/fix_comments`.

Please follow these guidelines when creating commits:

- Tag your branch with a valid [commit type](#https://github.com/pvdlg/conventional-commit-types) followed by a colon. Describe it using snake case and a captital at the start. e.g., `feat: Add_login_page` or `docs: Fix_comments`.
